title: How I built Liftosaur
---

Liftosaur is a weightlifting tracker app, where you can build any weightlifting program you want, using simple built-in scripting language Liftoscript.

Like I told in [How I came to weightlifting], I wanted an app, that would be like Stronglifts 5x5, but flexible, so you could build any program in there.
