title: How I came to weightlifting
---

The idea of starting to workout was in my head for a while. Everybody says - once you hit your 30s mark, it's better to start taking care of your body, otherwise you may not get to the moment when you could finally enjoy your 401k fund.

I also would like to look better, more fit (and who wouldn't?). It's a common knowledge that the best way to achieve that is, well, gym!

The problem was though - how to start? Gym seemed intimidating - there're many various machines, there're dumbbells, kettlebells, barbells - how do I know which to use, how do I know I use them properly?

### Bodyweight

So, I put aside the gym idea, and decided to start with bodyweight exercises. I really liked the idea of bodyweight exercises. There was something in the approach you only use your own body to get stronger. Elegancy and simplicity of it attracted me.

I googled a bit, and found the book of Mark Lauren - "You Are Your Own Gym". It had good reviews on Amazon, and there was a nice phone app that would tell you how to do exercises and what they should be. There were 10 week programs, it all looked fun, so I started working out 3 times a week, using the phone app that accompanies the book.

In about a month my motivation started to go down. I started to skip workouts, and in about one more month I finally quit. I only went til 8th week.

The workouts in that app were pretty challenging for me, but the biggest issue was - I didn't feel I got stronger. Bodyweight excercises are pretty hard to progress on. The idea is that you progress by switching to more challenging versions of exercises (like you start with incline push-ups, then horizontal push-ups, then declide push-ups, then one-arm push ups, etc), but the difficulty bump when you go from one version to another is so big, it's hard to actually make it.

At the end of 8th week I was pretty disappointed - the workouts didn't get any easier, I was very tired after each workout, and I didn't feel I got stronger. My motivation finally died and I quit.

Now I realize 2 months are not really enough to see any progress, but back then I was expecting magical transformations in my body, and when I didn't seen them I got quite frustrated.

### Weightlifting

One year passed. I write software for living, and I was reading Michael Snoyman's blog - mostly he writes about the programming language Haskell, but he also had a set of blog posts about [lifting and health](https://www.snoyman.com/blog/2017/06/why-i-lift).

I find those kind of articles very trustworthy - fitness is not what he sells, it's just his hobby, and he's also a software engineer, so I find his experience very relatable. After reading those articles, I was very pumped, and decided to start weight lifting as well. He recommended [Stronglifts 5x5](https://stronglifts.com/5x5/) as a simple weightlifting program to start with, and I decided to give it a try!

I read the site, read the exercise descriptions, it all made sense, it was quite simple! The idea is that you do so-called 5 "compound" exercises (they work wide range of muscles of your body) 3 times a week, increasing weight each day. The exercise descriptions were veeeeery long and very repetetive though, he was repeating the same things and the same principles over and over and over again - no wonder there're like 20 thousands words per each exercise. But if you google something like "How to do deadlifts", you'll get some good videos at the top of search results explaining how to do those with proper form.

Then, I had to choose a gym. I had Anytime Fitness, LA Fitness and Planet Fitness in 15-minute drive distance around my house, and Planet Fitness was an obvious winner because it was cheap as peanuts - \$10 per month! I was going to visit it first, if it doesn't work by some reason - visit Anytime Fitness and LA Fitness.

Planet Fitness surprised me quite a lot. The gym itself was huge, it got all those fancy machines, but there was no single barbell at all! No power racks, no squat racks. Even no dumbbells. But rows and rows of empty treadmills, I think 5 smith machines, some other weird looking equipment... Stronglifts program required a power rack and a barbell, so I had to pass on it.

LA Fitness was even bigger. It was massive 2-story building with a pool, basketball court, tens of treadmills again, and two power racks with barbells, with a line of 3 people for each... Chance of staying in line for bench presses like it was in 2010 for iPhone 4 was not super exciting, so that was a pass too.

Anytime Fitness was a cozy small gym with not-so-cozy pricing. There was one squat rack and one power rack though, 2 barbells, rich set of dumbbells. And the main thing - there was no people. I was alone. The whole gym was empty. At 5pm. On Tuesday. That means it's empty pretty much all the time. That was a big deal for me - to ensure I won't lose any time staying in line and waiting while somebody is hard working on their curls staying in a rack. I got my wallet, and subscribed for a year.

Stronglifts 5x5 program was definitely way more fun than "You are your own gym". It was maybe too easy first (since you literally start with empty barbell), but that would give me time to adjust, get into habit of visiting the gym, work on proper form. But the most fun part was that I felt progress. At first - every day, then maybe every week, or even every couple weeks, but my numbers went up and up. I saw that upwards graph in the phone app. Each time the weight I lift goes up, it feels like a little win, and it gives me that endorphine shot. This is addictive. I find it very hard to keep myself motivated for long-term goals - like, I will look great if I keep doing this for next 2 years regularly. I mean - yes, probably, but if not - I'll have hundreds of hours spent on nothing. And that suspicion eats you. But here - you successfully completed your 5x5 of bench press - done, you got your weight bump for the next workout - you feel a win. And it's awesome.

In about 3 months I hit my first deload (when you have to reduce the weight on a barbell because you couldn't accomplish 5 sets of 5 reps for an exercise). But still I were able to progress. In about 3 months more I hit plateau, and just kept deloading and getting to the same level, not being able to increase weight anymore.

At that time, I was at:

- 185lb squat 5x5
- 150lb bench press 5x5
- 105lb overhead press 5x5
- 130lb barbell row 5x5
- 260lb deadlift 1x5

By that time I was already reading a lot of articles related to weightlifting, was hanging out on reddit.com/r/fitness, and found probably the best introduction into weightlifting - thefitness.wiki. I really like how short and to-the-point is all the material there. On Reddit, people mostly criticized Stronglifts 5x5 for being strongly skewed towards squats, and at the same time praised 5/3/1 programs by Jim Wendler, for being a balanced program. thefitness.wiki recommends 5/3/1 for Beginners as a starter, so I picked it up.

It worked great! I liked that the pace is slower, but you steadily keep increasing weights every 3 weeks instead. I got used to Stronglifts 5x5 app though, it was simple yet very convenient - it increased or decreased the weights when appropriate, had all the necessary functionality. But it was designed specifically for Stronglifts 5x5, you can't adjust it to any other program.

I wanted to find an app I could use for a long time, even if I change programs. I wanted to be able to tweak programs if necessary, and couldn't find anything like that. Other apps were either designed for one specific routine (GZCLP, 5/3/1, etc), or had a pack of popular routines, but none gave full flexibility in program editing. And it makes sense - to make it possible, you have to have full-grown, turing-complete programming language built-in. I could do that. I'm a software engineer, so I can write an app, where there will be a built-in specialized programming language, that allows you to express any possible weightlifting program. It will be shipped with popular weightlifting programs and will provide UI to make simple modifications in the routines, but if you want to create something completely new and nothing like before, you can always get to the lowest level and use the scripting language - Liftoscript!

After about 6 months of building it during my spare time, it resulted in Liftosaur! I use it for tracking my lifts since April, 2020, and it goes great (though I'm obviously biased). It also gives me additional motivation to keep working out, since I could think of some feature, then implement it in the app, and then try it out during my own workouts.

I now have way better picture what it takes to start weightlifting, and if I started today, I'd probably start with the [Basic Beginner Routine](https://thefitness.wiki/routines/r-fitness-basic-beginner-routine/), and would follow [thefitness.wiki](https://thefitness.wiki/) later on.

Lifting weights is super fun. You feel powerful when you lift heavy weights, you get your little wins pretty often, it's fun to chase numbers (the weight you lift, the reps you could do, etc). There're a lot of health benefits too, but it's hard to quantify them, and they look more like long term goals, which I have hard time to really care about. And you're looking better and better in the process (though that transformation is very slow, it takes years to really see difference, so again - more like long-term thing). I'm in it for 1.5 years for now, and hopefully it's just a start.
